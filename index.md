# NVivo Workshops: Overview 

## Description

The online workshops cover both Mac and PC versions of NVivo 1.x.

**Part 1:** NVivo is a computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software.
In this introductory workshop you will learn about the benefits of working with NVivo, how to set it up, the types of sources you can use, and how to import them into NVivo. You will also learn about nodes, codes, and queries.

**Part 2:** NVivoâ€™s classification capabilities will help you add demographic data to your nodes, and bibliographic data to your sources. Datasets allow you to import and work with tabular material from spreadsheets, database tables, surveys, and social media. If you are comfortable with the basics of NVivo (importing sources, creating nodes, and coding) and would like to explore new ways of working with qualitative data, this workshop is for you!
