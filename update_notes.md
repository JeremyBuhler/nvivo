## Notes/questions about updating NVivo site
General approach: less is more. On the public-facing site only include components that are in active use or that we are committed to maintaining. Where possible, provide links to existing resources instead of creating/maintaining our own. 

### Landing page (index.md)
- I suggest removing all handouts. The files currently on the site are from 2016 (Mac) and 2018 (PC) and screenshots are from previous NVivo versions. 

- Added information about NVivo version (1.x)

### NVivo "how to" videos (NVivo - How to Videos.md)
- Added top level title that matches title in navigation bar, reduced size of sub-headers
- Many videos in the "how to" section are for NVivo 12. Find NVivo 1.x replacements? Delete?
- Should we keep this page given the extra work Amir has done to find videos for specific tasks?

### Qualitative coding 
New page for the qualitative coding series with placeholder videos and drop-down boxes for references. Comments?

### New page for video resources
