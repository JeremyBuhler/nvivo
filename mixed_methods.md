# Mixed methods workshop

In April 2022 the Koerner Library Research Commons commons offered a workshop called _Introduction to Mixed Methods Analysis_. The workshop was developed by Amir Michalovich and Maria Laricheva and draws on their expertise in qualitative and quantitative methods, respectively.

This workshop is not currently offered but the slides are rich in content: [download workshop slides as pdf](slides/2022_intro_to_mixed_methods_analysis_slides.pdf)
